## Session 1 - 07/06/25, 5 hours
I spent my time reading and understanding the hackclub guide to creating a macropad and then decided what components to include in my own. I created a schematic and then worked on the PCB, though I had a bit of trouble working out how get the 3d models to work.

I created the case in Fusion 360.

## Session 3 - 08/06/25, 4 hours
I realised my OLED display was upside down so fixed that and rerouted everything. I then readjusted the sizes for my case as they were a bit off and learnt how to import 3d models to make sure everything fit.
