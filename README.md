# Pomodoro Pad
Pomodoro Pad is a 3 key macropad with a rotary encoder and an OLED Display, using KMK firmware. It will act as a pomodoro timer with a start, pause/resume, and reset button, with the rotary encoder to set the timer length. (The firmware will be updated to work after the parts arrive.)
